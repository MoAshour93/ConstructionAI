The level 3 coding for the activity: Testing and commissioning is: 09.2.11 - Testing and commissioning.I am afraid that in this case I do not have any access to any further level of details.  From my knowledge, NRM1 provides level 4 coding information only in section 09 Preliminaries.</s>\n"

The term \"NRM1\" is not directly related to testing and commissioning in the context of electrical or electronic systems. Instead, it's a term used in the National Regulatory Reform Act of 1996, specifically in the context of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It refers to a set of rules that streamline the regulatory process for certain industries. If you're looking for information related to testing and commissioning in the context of electrical or electronic systems, you might want to consider terms like \"commissioning process,\" \"test and inspection,\" or \"acceptance testing.\" If you could please provide more context or clarify your question, I'd be happy to help further.</s>\n"
